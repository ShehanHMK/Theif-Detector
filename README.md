### **This is a first year project done by group of students in Electronic and Telecommunication engineering department - _University of Moratuwa_**


### _Overview_

 - This device senses and detects any human motion and sends a SMS message to the user notifying him about a motion in his place. Users can place this device anywhere they like,
most probably in places where thieves can enter to their living/ working areas.
